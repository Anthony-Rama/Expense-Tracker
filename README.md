# SWE-Swift-Project-Spring-2023

To use this app simply add an expense using the plus symbol, add a remark about the expense, categroize if this is an expense or income, select a date,
and save the expense. Your expense will then be saved and displayed in the app. 

Note to Professor: I initially had a github repo that had all my previous data but it seems I deleted it/lost it (I am new to git and github) so my links in the previous assignment are invalid. However, I uploaded all my files from the old repo here!
